# AI-Enhanced Face Recognition and Access Control System  

---

## Project Overview  
The AI-Enhanced Face Recognition and Access Control System is a web-based solution designed to streamline security, automate access control, and enhance identity verification. By leveraging state-of-the-art "deep learning models" such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system ensures real-time and highly accurate face detection, recognition, and permission management. This project is adaptable for a variety of environments including workplaces, campuses, and public facilities.

## Key Features 
1. Real-Time Face Recognition:  
   - Accurate detection and identification of individuals in live or uploaded images.  
   - Feature extraction using CNNs for precise comparisons.  

2. Access Control:  
   - Validates permissions for entry and specific actions (e.g., attendance tracking, discipline monitoring).  
   - Alerts administrators of unauthorized access attempts.  

3. Ethical and Secure:  
   - Privacy-focused with secure data handling.  
   - Anti-spoofing mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access via fake images or masks.  

4. User-Friendly Interface:  
   - Responsive web application for database management, monitoring, and configuration.  
   - Integration with devices like IP cameras and smartphones.  

5. **Continuous Learning**:  
   - Adaptive models improve recognition accuracy over time.

## **Setup and Installation**  
### **Prerequisites**:  
1. Python 3.8 or higher  
2. Virtual environment (recommended)  
3. Required libraries (install via `requirements.txt`)  

### **Installation Steps**:  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository_url>  
   cd AI-Face-Recognition-System  
   ```  

2. Set up a virtual environment:  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS  
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows  
   ```  

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. Place the `ORL_faces.npz` dataset in the project directory.  

5. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```

## **Usage**  
### **Dataset Preparation**:  
The system uses the **ORL Faces dataset**, which includes images of faces with varying poses, expressions, and lighting conditions. Ensure the dataset is properly structured as provided.  

### **System Workflow**:  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Normalize images and resize them to `(112x92x1)`.  
   - Split data into training, validation, and testing sets.  

2. **Model Training**:  
   - Train a custom CNN with layers for feature extraction, pooling, and classification.  
   - Monitor accuracy and loss through training history.  

3. **Face Recognition and Access Control**:  
   - Detect and align faces using live feeds or uploaded images.  
   - Compare detected faces against a pre-registered database.  
   - Grant or deny access based on permissions.  

4. **Alert System**:  
   - Generate alerts for unauthorized access via email or other notification mechanisms.

## **Visualization and Metrics**  
- **Accuracy and Loss**: Plots training and validation accuracy/loss.  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Highlights model performance by comparing predictions to true labels.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for detailed insights.  

---

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Implement **real-time video stream processing**.  
- Expand to support larger and more diverse datasets.  
- Integrate with **cloud-based services** like AWS Rekognition for scalability.  
- Add advanced anti-spoofing measures (e.g., 3D facial recognition).
